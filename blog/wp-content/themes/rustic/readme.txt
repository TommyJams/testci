Rustic WordPress Theme by Patrick Bagby
=======================================

This theme comes with a "Search" box built in(at the top of the page by the tree), so there's no need to add the "Search" widget.
If a second "Search" box appears in the sidebar you can leave it there if you like it, or do the following to remove it:

From your WordPress Admin panel: Click the 'Appearance' tab. Next click 'Widgets' tab. 
Over on the right look for the 'Search' widget inside either the 'Primary Widget Area' or the 'Secondary Widget Area'. 
Take away the 'Search' widget by dragging it out of the box. This should solve the problem. 
You'll still have a search box on your website because it's built into the theme (the one up by the tree).

This theme also supports 'gallery' and 'asides' post formats.  Make 'gallery' and 'asides' categories if you want to use them. Posts using [gallery] shortcode can be assigned to the 'gallery' category to utilize the 'gallery post format. One thumbnail will appear in archive pages with a link to the rest of the gallery. Posts assigned to the 'asides' category will appear as short statements without a title.

My favorite new feature is the Portfolio capability. Just make some portfolio items(a new post type), make a portfolio(a new taxonomy), and add it to the main menu. Click the link to view your portfolio. Each portfolio item is click-able, and opens a "pretty photo" light-box. Pictures, music, and videos can all be included.

Good Luck and Happy Sailing with your Website!
